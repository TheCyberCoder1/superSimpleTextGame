# superSimpleTextGame

Welcome to this fun project I hope people will check out.

If you want to participate here is the basic idea of the game:
a python game where user inputs lead through a series of actions till they complete all the tasks/fights/missions (will be decided once game has been kicked off).

Well I hope you like the idea and decide to join in!

Note: we are also integrating swift so we can make an app to do these things.
